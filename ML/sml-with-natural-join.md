(partial notes only)
Natural join is a fundamental operation in many database operations.  For example, to combine two tables to obtain a set of tables that are more prescriptive.

There has been a bunch of work:
* See SQL integration in SML-sharp (ICFP 11)
* Machiavelli database language

This work builds a polymorphic type system for natural join.
