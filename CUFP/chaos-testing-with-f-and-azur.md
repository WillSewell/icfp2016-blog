Why Chaos engineering? There are lots of ways to test. If youre building
systems that scale, have you tested various things like timeouts that are hard
to comprehensively cover. The Volkswagen emissions scandal was detected because
the results were too uniform, and not enough chaos!  Its super important to
test the interactions in your environment.

Jet.com is a NYC based startup that launched in July 2015 and is an ecommerce
company that was bought for 3.3 billion purchase by Walmart.  Has around 700
microservices and is a heavy user of F# and is not a heavy user of AWS since
they are in competition with Amazon. Also a large variety of technologies like
Python, Node, R, Python etc and not afraid to find the right tool for the job.
