(I didn't follow most of this)

What are coeffects? Computations make *changes to the context* (**effects**) and make *demands from the context* (**coeffects**)

Per-variable coeffects.

Type and coeffect system, coeffect meta languages

Interaction of effects and coeffects.

Examples
- security levels (coeffect) masking non-determinism (effect)
- Exceptions (effect) change linear reuse bounds (coeffect)

Core calculus - linear-lambda calculus with effect and coeffect types.

Graded monads for effects and graded comonads for coeffects.

### Conclusion

Foundation for considering effect-coeffect interaction.

Further possibilities - exceptions interacting with security levels, non-determinism with probabilistic variables.

Graded distributive laws useful in other contexts.
